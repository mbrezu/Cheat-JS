<h1>Cheat-JS - macro for JavaScript. Kinda.</h1>

<h2>Important Note</h2>

<p>Cheat-JS includes a modified version of <code>parse-js</code>, written by Marijn
Haverbeke. This is necessary because I (Miron Brezuleanu) needed to
modify <code>parse-js</code> a little. The license of <code>parse-js</code> is in the
<code>LICENSE-parse-js.txt</code> file. The modified files from <code>parse-js</code>
included in Cheat-JS are <code>parse.lisp</code>, <code>tokenize.lisp</code> and
<code>util.lisp</code>. The modifications were permitted by the <code>parse-js</code>
license. This is not an official copy of <code>parse-js</code> and is not
supported by Marijn Haverbeke. If the modified parsing code in
Cheat-JS breaks, it's exclusively Miron Brezuleanu's fault, because he
messed up the code.</p>

<h2>About Cheat-JS</h2>

<p>Cheat-JS is a JavaScript preprocessor that permits applying AST
transformations on JavaScript source. The AST transformations (macros)
are written in Common Lisp. Instead of writing:</p>

<pre><code>var greeter = (function () {
    return { 
        'hello': function(name) {
            console.log('hello, '+ name);
        };
    };
}());
</code></pre>

<p>Cheat-JS makes it possible to write:</p>

<pre><code>var greeter = @iife(
    return {
        'hello': function(name) {
            console.log('hello, '+ name);            
        }
    };
);
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of writing:</p>

<pre><code>function Person(name, shoeSize) {
    this.name = name;
    this.shoeSize = shoeSize;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Cheat-JS makes it possible to write:</p>

<pre><code>@defclass(Person, name, shoeSize)
</code></pre>

<p>(assuming that <code>@iife</code> and <code>@defclass</code> were defined as AST
transformations in Common Lisp code).</p>
